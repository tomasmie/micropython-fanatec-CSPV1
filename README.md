I made it work kind-of (no vibration motor) with a cheap raspberrypi-pico I had laying around.

I did not use Arduino cause I hate C, but used micropython instead. It should work on most cheap ESP32 devices too.

You will need adjusting the PINS in code to your wiring

For the vibration motor it needs some extra power, might look into it one day.
